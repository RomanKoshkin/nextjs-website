If you are reading this, chances are you are, just like me a couple of years ago, is fascinated by how nothing more than an mere algorithm run on a cold piece of silicon, can ever "paint" faces? Honestly, I can't even draw a tank, let alone a face, with all of its fine details like hair, shades, skin tone, light reflections in the eyes etc. I can't, but _it_ can.

Itâ€™s a good time to begin this journey and I hope this article gives you the tools needed to get started!
