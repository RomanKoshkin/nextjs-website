	title="TransLLaMa: LLM-based Simultaneous Translation System."
	year="2024"
	journal="arXiv"
	issue=""
	pageRange="2402.04636"
	authors="Roman Koshkin, Katsuhito Sudoh & Satoshi Nakamura"
	abstract="Decoder-only large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in text generation and reasoning. Nonetheless, they have limited applications in simultaneous machine translation (SiMT), currently dominated by encoder-decoder transformers. This study demonstrates that, after fine-tuning on a small dataset comprising causally aligned source and target sentence pairs, a pre-trained open-source LLM can control input segmentation directly by generating a special 'wait' token. This obviates the need for a separate policy and enables the LLM to perform English-German and English-Russian SiMT tasks with BLEU scores that are comparable to those of specific state-of-the-art baselines. We also evaluated closed-source models such as GPT-4, which displayed encouraging results in performing the SiMT task without prior training (zero-shot), indicating a promising avenue for enhancing future SiMT systems."

	title="convSeq: Fast and Scalable Method for Detecting Patterns in Spike Data."
	year="2024"
	journal="arXiv"
	issue=""
	pageRange="2402.01130"
	authors="Roman Koshkin, Tomoki Fukai"
	abstract="Spontaneous neural activity, crucial in memory, learning, and spatial navigation, often manifests itself as repetitive spatiotemporal patterns. Despite their importance, analyzing these patterns in large neural recordings remains challenging due to a lack of efficient and scalable detection methods. Addressing this gap, we introduce convSeq, an unsupervised method that employs backpropagation for optimizing spatiotemporal filters that effectively identify these neural patterns. Our method's performance is validated on various synthetic data and real neural recordings, revealing spike sequences with unprecedented scalability and efficiency. Significantly surpassing existing methods in speed, convSeq sets a new standard for analyzing spontaneous neural activity, potentially advancing our understanding of information processing in neural circuits."

	pageRange="TPT"
	abstract="Cell assemblies, putative units of neural computation, manifest themselves as repeating and temporally coordinated activity of neurons. However, understanding of their role in brain function is hampered by a lack of scalable methods for their unsupervised detection. We propose using a graph neural network for embedding spike data into a sequence of fixed size vectors and clustering them based on their self-similarity across time. We validate our method on synthetic data and real neural recordings."

	abstract="We utilized the event-related potential (ERP) technique to study neural activity associated with different levels of working memory (WM) load during simultaneous interpretation (SI) of continuous prose. The amplitude of N1 and P1 components elicited by task-irrelevant tone probes was significantly modulated as a function of WM load but not the direction of interpretation. Furthermore, the latency of the P1 increased significantly with WM load. The WM load effect on N1 latency, however, did not reach significance. Larger negativity under lower WM loads suggests that more attention is available to process the source message, providing the first electrophysiological evidence in support of the Efforts Model of SI. Relationships between the direction of interpretation and median WM load are also discussed."

	issue="RF Patent"
	pageRange="2747571"
	abstract="The invention relates to marketing technologies, and allows, based on the psychophysiological state, measured using an electrocephalograph, to objectively assess the listener's reaction to audio content according to an arbitrary range of affective categories (such as interest in, emotion to, agreement/disagreement with the content played etc.) , when conducting opinion polls, focus groups, as well as for educational process. The technical result achieved consists in obtaining an objective psychophysiological metric that allows one to judge how carefully the presented audio content was listened to, as well as its rating (in comparison with alternative audio content), and without the use of questionnaires, surveys or other methods prone to cognitive biases. The technical result is achieved due to the fact that the decision rule for decision trees is optimized based on the psychophysiological state, measured using an, recorded while a group of listeners listen to reference audio messages, selected from a pre-created database of reference audio messages and their corresponding affective ratings (being an integral part of the database) collected in a preliminary survey of a large group of respondents."

	place="Saint-Petersburg, Russia"
	abstract="Due to the inherent complexity of simultaneous interpreting (SI), testing its theoretical models in a simple, but ecologically valid experimental paradigm has been problematic. We attempted to overcome some of the associated challenges using a novel method for WM load estimation in conjunction with the event-related potentials (ERP) technique. Specifically, we tested the prediction of the Efforts Model of SI (Gile, 1988) that increased WM load impairs the processing of the source message during SI.Consistent with the model, the N1 amplitude that we used as an index of attention was significantly modulated as a function of WM load. Negativity in the N1 range decreased at higher levels of WM load, suggesting shallower processing of the source message under high WM load. Our findings represent the first electrophysiological evidence in support of the Efforts Model."

	title="N1 ERP As an Index of Depth of Processing In Simultaneous Interpreting"

	conference="Communication, Computation, and Cognitive Processes"
	pdf="http://bit.ly/2lhyWjP"
	date="September 28-29, 2016"
	place="Moscow, Russia"
	abstract="Researchers have extensively studied simultaneous interpretation (SI), but understanding how the brain manages the limited resources of attention and working memory (WM) systems under such extreme conditions of language control has remained elusive. Here, we aim to use the event-related potentials (ERP) to investigate the interplay of attention and WM load during simultaneous interpretation of real speech in an ecologically valid overt production paradigm. Previous research using simple dichotic listening paradigms showed the N1 ERP component to be modulated by attention thus making it a suitable temporally precise index of attention. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that at larger WM loads, attention to the source message is markedly reduced as it gets redeployed towards processing the backlog of previous information. If this is borne out, translation fidelity is more likely to be compromised during periods of higher WM load. Additionally, we examine if concurrent articulation degrades attention to, and processing of, the source message in SI. Although such a setup requires non-trivial artifact correction techniques pushing the limits of the ERP method, the pattern of results based on one participant’s data suggests an effect of WM load on the N1 amplitude , which is in agreement with our original hypothesis."

	conference="IEEE International Symposium «Video and Audio Signal Processing in the Context of Neurotechnologies»"
	pdf="http://bit.ly/2ANhSVD"
	date="June 26-30, 2017"
	place="Saint Petersburg, Russia"
	abstract="We describe a novel data driven spatial filtering technique that can be applied to the evoked potentials in the EEG data in order to find statistically significant hidden differential activations, which cannot be found by standard single-channel analysis. The underlying optimization problem is formulated as a generalized Rayleigh quotient maximization problem. The technique is based on the known morphological characteristics of the response: the optimal filter maximizes the difference in the target interval when the component typically occurs and at the same time minimizes the difference in the flanker interval. The technique is equipped with a relevant randomization-based statistical test to assess the significance of the discovered phenomenon. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated with the simulated ERP data, the results are compared with the competing ICA-based method. Furthermore, we describe an application of the proposed method to the EEG data acquired in two studies: study devoted to the simultaneous language interpreting (group analysis) and analysis of the auditory neuroplasticity (single subject application). We show how the differential components can be detected after filtration and support our results with the permutation statistical test, topographies analysis and single-trial evidence."
