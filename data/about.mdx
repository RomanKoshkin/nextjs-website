title: About Me

HeyðŸ‘‹, my name is Roman Koshkin.

I am a computational neuroscience PhD student at the <Link href="/about#projects" className="transition-color duration-300 hover:text-gray-600 dark:hover:text-gray-200"> Neural Coding and Brain Computing Unit</Link> (OIST), which I joined with a vision of building next-gen AI systems that rival the speed and efficiency of biological brains. As a former linguist, I am also interested in simultaneous machine translation, and multi-agent reasoning. I love making things that work.

Before I joined the NCBC, I had spent four months at the Cognitive Neurorobotics Unit where I 'taught' a humanoid robot to perform a reach-and-grasp task by combining a limited set of learned motor primitives into diverse and novel motion trajectories. This work was inspired by the stochastic PV-RNN architecture.

As I am exploring this frontier as a scientist, I have several side projects (mostly in deep learning).

## Miscellaneous

 - I was a master's student of Dr. Alex Ossadtchi at the Center for Bioelectric Interfaces.
 - As a hobby, I build bots for medium-frequency crypto trading, multi-agent LLM-based chatbots and customized image generation models.
