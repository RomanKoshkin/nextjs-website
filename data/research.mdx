## Emergence and Functional Role of Spontaneous Activity in Spiking Neural Networks

Bilogical neural networks maintain a certain level of spontaneous activity (SA) at all times, even in the absence of external stimuli. If SA were nothing more than just noise due to random discharges of neurons, as originally thought by some, it would be a big waste of energy given that mammalian brains consume a considerable amount of energy even in quiescent states like sleep. Recent evidence suggests that SA is implicated in memory, spatial navigation and learning, but precisely what its computaional role is remains unclear. In this project I investigate, using biologically plausible and experimentally constrained spiking recurrent network models, how SA emerges and persists as well as how it can enable and/or enhance memory function. The ultimate goal of this project is to explore if and how structured SA can be useful in next-generation AI.

## Emergence and Functional Role of Spontaneous Activity in Spiking Neural Networks

My recent research has been under the following themes:

Self-organized cell assemblies as a substrate of episodic memory: Model of asscociative memory under a biologically-inspired STP-dependent symmetric STDP learning rule.
Preplay as a learning booster: I am modeling how new knowlede can be bootstrapped from preexisting topological and temporal structure of a contineously plastic binary neural network.
Role of spontaneous neural activity in memory: Spontaneous neural activity in animals has been shown to reflect sensory priors. I aim to develop a biologically plausible simplified SNN model that can reliably store sensory priors and use them for task performance.
Before I joined the NCBC, I had spent four months at the Cognitive Neurorobotics Unit where I 'taught' a humanoid robot to perform a reach-and-grasp task by combining a limited set of learned motor primitives into diverse and novel motion trajectories. This work was inspired by the stochastic PV-RNN architecture.

As I am exploring this frontier as a scientist, I have several side projects (mostly in deep learning). I also like to [share](https://twitter.com) what my expertise in this area.

## Projects

<div className="grid sm:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
	<Project url="https://github.com/RomanKoshkin/Alienify" title="Alienify">
		Image style and content transformation using a GAN. The model blends the orininal StyleGAN2 and
		the same network but fine-tuned on another dataset (e.g. aliens and zombies). You can train the
		network on your own dataset.
	</Project>
	<Project url="https://spotify-badge.vercel.app" title="Spotify Badge">
		Once I realized Spotify has API I'm trying to utilize it. Since GitHub added Profile README.md I
		wanted to share what is playing in my Spotify there. It led to this project.
	</Project>
	<Project url="https://github.com/radio-t/radio-t-site" title="Radio-T">
		I joined the project with target of optimizations bundle size and reduce number of dependencies.
		As goal we reached 90+ WebVitals score.
	</Project>
	<Project url="https://reproxy.io" title="Reproxy">
		I like when cool projects have fancy design. Connected with that I created logo and web-site for
		the project.

## Conference Talks

<Talk
	title="How to adopt new technology and don't waste time"
	lang="ru"
	conferences={[{ name: 'TechLead Conference', year: '2020' }]}
>
	Told to the audience about TechRadar, what is it, and how to utilize it for a team or for the
	whole company. Explained why TechRadar could help adopt new tecnologies and why it's more
	important not just create it but build whole process to manage it.

	conferences={[
		{ name: 'Highload++ Conference', year: '2015' },
		{ name: 'Mail.ru Meetup', year: '2015' },
	]}
>
	Spoke about optimizations that were done for get maximum speed of loading of Mail.ru main page.
	Introduced how we use pure V8 engine for isomorphic rendering and how we reached really good
	perfomance on the server-side as well as on client-side.
