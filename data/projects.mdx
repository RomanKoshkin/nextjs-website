## Past

### Neurobarometer

Neurobarometer was a project funded by Neurontrend LLC and the Russian Venture Company to develop an algorithm for objective estimation of people's affective state for neuromarketing research. Based our method (now patented), we built an easy-to-use application that provides a bias-free estimate of respondents' opinion of a product sample based on real-time 32-channel EEG. The first prototype was built in 2019, and the application is now ready and sold to enterprise customers. My responsibilities in this project included developing optimal data preprocessing pipelines and a robust prediction model.

### Human-Robot Interaction

This project explored the ability of stochastic recurrent neural networks trained on a small set of motor primitives to generate meaningful novel patterns with limited corrective feedback from the experimenter.
